# CYNO: Powering the Next Generation of Faster, Smarter Cancer Care
## From 14 Days to 10 Minutes

---

### Executive Summary

CYNO transforms cancer diagnosis in resource-strapped tier-2 and tier-3 hospitals. From 14 days of waiting to just 10 minutes of actionable insights, this AI-powered platform democratizes precision oncology for emerging markets.

## The Crisis: Why Smaller Hospitals Need Innovation

### The Diagnosis Delay Problem

In emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia, cancer patients in smaller hospitals face 5-14 day waits for multi-specialty review due to specialist shortages. These delays allow aggressive tumors to progress, while clinician overwhelm from massive data volumes risks staging errors that can reduce survival by months.

> **Key Insight:** 80% of tier-2 and tier-3 hospitals lack multidisciplinary tumor boards, forcing single clinicians to handle overwhelming case loads alone.

### The Expertise Gap Crisis

Tier-2 and tier-3 hospitals lack the specialist teams that elite centers rely on:

- Diagnostic delays stretch 5-14 days as cases wait for external consultations
- Overwhelmed doctors face data overload from scans and shifting guidelines
- Without standardized oversight, treatment varies wildly
- Hospitals face legal and financial risks from unverified diagnostics

---

## The Solution: CYNO's 10-Minute Workflow

### How It Works

CYNO eliminates diagnostic delays by delivering comprehensive expert-level analysis instantly. The workflow is straightforward:

1. **Upload** — Patient data (scans, biopsies, notes) uploaded via secure Azure portal
2. **Analyze** — Five specialized AI agents process data in parallel
3. **Resolve** — Central Orchestrator merges findings and resolves conflicts
4. **Report** — Real-time tumor board report delivered with staging and treatment options

### The Multi-Agent Intelligence Engine

CYNO deploys five dedicated AI agents, each trained on domain-specific data:

- **Radiology Agent** — Interprets CT/MRI scans for tumor location, size, and characteristics
- **Pathology Agent** — Parses biopsy reports and lab data via NLP
- **Clinical Agent** — Reviews patient history, vitals, and comorbidities
- **Research Agent** — Cross-references findings with PubMed guidelines and latest trials
- **Compliance Agent** — Flags drug interactions, risks, and regulatory issues

> **Real Impact:** Tier-2/3 hospitals save 3,000-10,000 INR per case and cut hospitalization by 2-3 days, breaking even in 12-18 months.

## Technical Architecture

### Built on Azure Health Infrastructure

CYNO's foundation ensures security and compliance:

- End-to-end encryption for scans, genomics, and records
- HIPAA, GDPR, and India/Southeast Asia data sovereignty compliance
- Audit trails log all agent outputs for regulatory transparency
- Scalable cloud handles massive volumes and offline uploads

### Advanced AI Capabilities

#### Natural Language Processing

NLP engines convert narrative chaos into structured insights, parsing doctor notes for key data like grade, size, and margins while preserving clinical context across multilingual notes.

#### Genomic Analysis

Automated pipelines analyze DNA samples for somatic mutations, calculate Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) to identify immunotherapy candidates, and democratize genomics for tier-2/3 hospitals lacking sequencers.

#### Predictive Modeling

CYNO synthesizes agent data and genomics to forecast 5-year survival curves per patient and predict immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted drug efficacy based on genetics and history.

## Real-World Impact: A Day in the Life

### Morning: Patient Intake

A clinician uploads CT/MRI scans, biopsy reports, notes, and vitals to the CYNO dashboard. The system auto-de-identifies data and triggers parallel agent analysis while the clinician continues other cases.

### 10 Minutes Later: Instant Report Delivery

The Real-Time Tumor Board Report arrives with:

- Comprehensive staging and TMB insights
- 5-year survival predictions
- Evidence-based treatment options
- Critical action items (e.g., Order PET scan, Immunotherapy viable)
- Risk flags and contraindications

### Outcome: From Guesswork to Standards

Instead of single-doctor decisions, clinicians now have standardized multi-specialty consensus that:

- Eliminates 5-14 day consult chains
- Reduces staging errors by 20-30%
- Matches elite-center accuracy
- Provides audit trails for medico-legal protection

## Business Model: Accessible Precision Oncology

### Tiered Pricing for Every Hospital

CYNO's B2B SaaS model fits varying budgets:

- **Setup** — 1-5 Lakh INR (one-time integration)
- **Monthly** — 30K-1.5 Lakh INR (recurring subscription)
- **Per-case** — 250-500 INR (variable cost)

### Why CYNO Outpaces Single-Silo Competitors

Rivals like PathAI and Qure.ai excel in single domains (pathology or radiology) but miss the bigger picture. CYNO's orchestration:

- Combines radiology, pathology, clinical NLP, research, and compliance
- Resolves real-world conflicts (imaging vs. biopsy discrepancies)
- Handles unstructured data and genomic insights
- Justifies affordability through comprehensiveness

### ROI: Break-Even in 12-18 Months

**Financial Breakdown**

**Cost Savings:** 3-5 specialist consults (3K-10K INR/case) + 2-3 hospital days saved

**For 100 cases/month:** 3-10 Lakh INR saved vs. 30K-40K subscription cost

**Additional benefits:** Reduced re-treatment from errors (20-30% expense reduction), improved patient retention, competitive advantage as AI-powered cancer center

## Roadmap: Scaling to Global Impact

### Phase 1: Solid Tumor Optimization (2025-2026)

- Refine agents for breast, lung, cervical cancers dominating India/Southeast Asia
- Integrate EHR systems for seamless hospital workflows
- Expand genomic databases
- Launch pilots in 50-100 tier-2/3 facilities across India, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines

### Phase 2: Hematologic Expansion (2026-2028)

- Adapt framework for blood cancers (leukemia, lymphoma)
- Add hematology-specific agents and flow cytometry analysis
- Enhance predictive models for CAR-T therapies
- Roll out to 500 hospitals with regulatory approvals

### Phase 3: Global Scale (2028-2030)

- Partner with WHO, NGOs, and governments for LMIC deployment
- Support 10 languages and offline-first modes for rural access
- Integrate with national cancer registries
- Aim for 10,000 hospitals covering 70% of emerging-market oncology volume

## Barriers and Path Forward

### Addressing Clinician Adoption

Success requires transparent reasoning, human oversight mechanisms, and demonstrated clinical validation through prospective studies published in oncology journals.

### Infrastructure Challenges

Connectivity barriers are overcome through edge computing and impact investor funding, enabling offline-first functionality for rural areas.

### Regulatory Momentum

Country-specific approvals (CDSCO India, ASEAN bodies) build trust as pilots demonstrate consistent 20-30% error reduction, accelerating adoption across emerging markets.
